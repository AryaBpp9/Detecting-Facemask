## Before you start

Let's make sure that we have access to GPU. We can use `nvidia-smi` command to do that. In case of any problems navigate to `Edit` -> `Notebook settings` -> `Hardware accelerator`, set it to `GPU`, and then click `Save`.

"""## Install YOLOv8

‚ö†Ô∏è YOLOv8 is still under heavy development. Breaking changes are being introduced almost weekly. We strive to make our YOLOv8 notebooks work with the latest version of the library. Last tests took place on **03.01.2024** with version **YOLOv8.0.196**.

If you notice that our notebook behaves incorrectly - especially if you experience errors that prevent you from going through the tutorial - don't hesitate! Let us know and open an [issue](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/issues) on the Roboflow Notebooks repository.

YOLOv8 can be installed in two ways‚Ää-‚Ääfrom the source and via pip. This is because it is the first iteration of YOLO to have an official package.

"""## CLI Basics

If you want to train, validate or run inference on models and don't need to make any modifications to the code, using YOLO command line interface is the easiest way to get started. Read more about CLI in [Ultralytics YOLO Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli/).

```

"""## Deploy model on Roboflow

Once you have finished training your YOLOv8 model, you‚Äôll have a set of trained weights ready for use. These weights will be in the `/runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt` folder of your project. You can upload your model weights to Roboflow Deploy to use your trained weights on our infinitely scalable infrastructure.

The `.deploy()` function in the [Roboflow pip package](https://docs.roboflow.com/python) now supports uploading YOLOv8 weights.

To upload model weights, add the following code to the ‚ÄúInference with Custom Model‚Äù section in the aforementioned notebook:
"""

project.version(dataset.version).deploy(model_type="yolov8", model_path=f"{HOME}/runs/detect/train/")

#While your deployment is processing, checkout the deployment docs to take your model to most destinations https://docs.roboflow.com/inference

"""# Deploy Your Model to the Edge

In addition to using the Roboflow hosted API for deployment, you can use [Roboflow Inference](https://inference.roboflow.com), an open source inference solution that has powered millions of API calls in production environments. Inference works with CPU and GPU, giving you immediate access to a range of devices, from the NVIDIA Jetson to TRT-compatible devices to ARM CPU devices.

With Roboflow Inference, you can self-host and deploy your model on-device. You can deploy applications using the [Inference Docker containers](https://inference.roboflow.com/quickstart/docker/) or the pip package.

For example, to install Inference on a device with an NVIDIA GPU, we can use:

```
docker pull roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-gpu
```

Then we can run inference via HTTP:

```python
import requests

workspace_id = ""
model_id = ""
image_url = ""
confidence = 0.75
api_key = ""

infer_payload = {
    "image": {
        "type": "url",
        "value": image_url,
    },
    "confidence": confidence,
    "iou_threshold": iou_thresh,
    "api_key": api_key,
}
res = requests.post(
    f"http://localhost:9001/{workspace_id}/{model_id}",
    json=infer_object_detection_payload,
)

predictions = res.json()
```

Above, set your Roboflow workspace ID, model ID, and API key.

- [Find your workspace and model ID](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/workspace-and-project-ids?ref=blog.roboflow.com)
- [Find your API key](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication?ref=blog.roboflow.com#retrieve-an-api-key)

Also, set the URL of an image on which you want to run inference. This can be a local file.

_To use your YOLOv5 model commercially with Inference, you will need a Roboflow Enterprise license, through which you gain a pass-through license for using YOLOv5. An enterprise license also grants you access to features like advanced device management, multi-model containers, auto-batch inference, and more._
